# Tradfri Indicator

You can start the program like this. The `<IP>` needs to be the IP of the gateway.
During the first connection the script will ask for the "Security Code", which is printed on the backside of the gateway.
Further, connects will not require that code again.

`python3 ./tradfri-indicator <IP>`
