# Tradfri Indicator

You can install and run the program as shown.
During the first connection the script will ask for the "Security Code", which is printed on the backside of the gateway.
Further, connects will not require that code again.
The IP  address of the gateway will be detected automatically.

```bash
# Install
pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/jonasbb/tradfri-indicator

# Run
python3 -m tradfri_indicator
```
